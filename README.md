# Project
This is a (nearly) empty repo for your project. 

## Keeping it clean
Make sure the .gitignore is in the folder with your unity project. When you commit your project for the first time, there should be hundreds of files, not thousands.

Also be mindful of the assets you commit in this repository. When adding third party assets to your project, only commit the files you will actually be using. Once you surpass the 2 GB limit, you can't commit anymore and there will be no way to remove data.

## Templates
.gitlab/issue_templates contains templates for your user stories. Feel free to add templates or alter the existing one.

## Prototypes
Use a separate branch for each prototype. At the end of sprint 1 you can merge one of the prototypes to the main branch.
